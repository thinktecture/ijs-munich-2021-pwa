Progressive Web Apps are a great cross-platform application model, even if somewhat restricted in use—until now, that is. Project Fugu is an initiative led by Google, Microsoft, and Intel. Their goal: a more capable web. Home screen shortcuts, sharing files with other apps, clipboard, and file system access are only a few examples of Fugu’s powerful APIs. In this full-day workshop, we will implement a simple remake of a productivity app dinosaur: MS Paint. We will first implement the basic functionality, then make the app installable and offline-capable using the PWA APIs, and finally enrich the user experience even further with new Fugu APIs. Are you ready to superpower your Progressive Web App?
